                    <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">An arcade game where you control two fish characters that are joined by a rope. You have separate controls to move your characters in order to knock your enemies down - do so by touching the penguins with your rope. But be careful, sea urchins will appear to tear your rope and, if they do, you will lose the game. Game will also be over if you touch your enemies.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">Each time you hit an enemy, you will get points, and you'll get more the longer you survive. Share your high score with your friends!</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">I have little to say about this development because of its short duration but here is something about it:</p>
                        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">The idea</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">From the very beginning we had the idea of having the players joined by a rope but until quite some time of brainstorming we ended up with the idea of making a top down game where you control two characters, kill the enemies when making them collide with your rope and kill the player whenever he toches one enemy or the spikes break the rope.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Development</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">As soon as we could we started the development and tried to keep everything as simple as possible for being able to finish it on time.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">The development was quite straight forward, the only problem we mainly had was that we didn't get organised with the other programmer until we arrived at a point that we didn't know what to do.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">After that we got organised and polished the game as much as we could until the final hour came, that was the hour of chaos, suddenly the Unity Collab decided to change things that shouldn't be changed and suddenly lots of things were missing, luckily we finished the game just in time and submitted it right before the jam ended.</p>

                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Problems</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">During the development of this project there were basically two problems:</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>My knowledge of Unity:</strong> At that time, my level of programming was quite low, basically being in that project helped me to learn a lot more of Unity and with that, be more prepared for future projects.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>The programmer change problem:</strong> A huge problem was that the project was started by Balas and ended by me, that time when we changed was a bit confusing because you had a working game but with no idea how, so I lost some time trying to understand the whole logic of the project.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div style="color: whitesmoke;">
                        <div style="color: whitesmoke; text-align: justify;">
                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Improvements</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">After some time from this project, I can see that there are some improvements that could have been done.</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Difficulty curve:</strong> The game in the beginning is really short but as you progress in it, each game becomes larger than the last one and then there appear situations where a single game is too long so the only way to end it is by dying and not by arriving to the end of the level.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Lack of content for engaging the player:</strong> We had skins and some achievements, but nothing more, at the beginning you started unlocking some but after that you started to lose interest in getting them and then got tired of playing the game, that's something that could have been fixed by adding an in-game currency with upgrades or maybe some powerups to unlock.</li>
