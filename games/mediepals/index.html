                        <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">Development</h1>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">I participated in a Game Jam with another team and after we won that jam one of the other winners decided to make a dream team for this next big Spanish Game Jam.</p>
                        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Designing</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">When we started brainstorming the idea of the game we first thought a game about a turn-based shooter game but while we where starting to design the mechanics for that game someone said "a duel of swords!" followed by "a balloon fight!" after that, the whole scope changed and we started developing a game about minigames.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div style="overflow: hidden;">

                        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Programming</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">Right after the designing process ended, we started developing the whole concept and bit by bit started to get some things done.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">During the progress of developing that game I made my first contact with the shaders by making the balloon's fight paint effect and also learned a bit more of optimization.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">The last day of the development was the most stressful day of the three programmers, suddenly there were dozens of bugs and we were constantly fixing them while finishing the whole project and the other's playtesting the game and finding even more bugs, after some hardwork and having 30 minutes left, the time period was extended and we had 30 minutes more for adding some VFXs to the game, after that we uploaded the game at (literally) the last 6 seconds. After that was done, everyone could play the game <a href="https://geri8.itch.io/mediepals" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Problems</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">Of course, every development has its problems, so these are the ones from this game:</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Our scope:</strong> I can't denny that when designing the project we were a bit too much motivated about being such an amazing team that can do anything and that's why the crunch time came at the last day.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Our lack of knowledge of 3D:</strong> Ok, the team had two 3D artists, but most of the games we had programmed were made in 2D, so we had to learn some 3D things because we didn't have enough practice with it, so it made the initial development slower.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <aside><img src="../Images/MediepalsBlackboard.png" style="float: right;" height="400vh"></aside>
                    <div style="color: whitesmoke;">
                        <div style="color: whitesmoke; text-align: justify;">
                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Improvements</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">After some time from this project, I can see that there are some improvements that could have been done.</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Polish:</strong> Of course, we are talking about a Game Jam game, as I said before, our scope was too big so we ended up with not much time to polish the game and you can see that specially with the really artificial look instead of a human-like look, some things feel good but quite some don't and that's why sometimes you have to think about making a smaller game but that feels like a big one because of its polish.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>More minigames:</strong> Yeah, we can't ask to a 6-people team to develop dozens of minigames in just one week but that's one thing that a minigames game need, a large variety of them, if there are just a few the game easily feels repetitive and can rapidly quit the game for getting bored, instead we would need a large variety that doesn't repeat as easy as with just 5 of them.</li>
