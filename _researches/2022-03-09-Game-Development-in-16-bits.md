Nowadays, the vast majority of video games are developed using engines created especially for them. Whether using Unity, Unreal Engine or any other, developers create using the maximum facilities provided by new technologies.

However, within this large group of developers, there is a small group that is not looking for a way to take advantage of the maximum potential of current systems. Instead, they are looking for a way to create them for retro platforms that have become obsolete with the passage of time.

The main goal of this research is to dive deep into the technology of the past and work with it in the present.

During this research I developed a platformer videogame that I called Miner Mole and I wrote about all the progress I did as well as all the limitations I found during it.
