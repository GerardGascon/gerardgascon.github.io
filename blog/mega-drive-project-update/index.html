                    <p>An update about the current progress on the Mega Drive Project.</p>
                    <p>This project began on December while I was thinking about the theme of a project we do in highschool in Catalonia called <i>Treball de Recerca</i>, TdR for short. So well, while I was thinking about the theme, the ideas went from a simple game developed with Unity to a simulator about the evolution.</p>
                    <p>One day I remembered that there were people developing games for retro consoles, so I thought of making an NES game, the only problem was that I didn't have an NES, so decided to search for a Mega Drive alternative, and yeah, SGDK appeared. After that, spend days nor weeks trying to get something decent working, till somehow got a ball moving across the screen.</p>
                    <p>After all of that, some of my friends encouraged me to start a YouTube channel, and that I did, mainly because I felt like I needed something for keeping me motivated working on the game, until that time the longest time I had spent developing a game was a month and I needed something to help overcoming this large development.</p>
                    <h3>The end of the Devlogs</h3>
                    <p>Don't get me wrong, I love Devlogs, I watch Devlogs almost everyday and I enjoy recording them, but one thing that I saw in my Devlogs that was different from the others' was the lack of new content for them, that's why my rate for publishing them has been decreasing since the end of March, because that feeling of lack of content started growing inside me.</p>
                    <h3>The solution</h3>
                    <p>It's time to officially break my upload rate, from now on I will be uploading videos whenever I can and want, those videos will go from showcasing a small part of gameplay in a really short video to a large one talking about a large amount of changes.</p>
                    <p>By doing that I won't be constantly working with a deadline for having something done and recorded ready for an upload, now I will be going back to something like my 2020 era, where most of my progress was shared across <a href="https://twitter.com/G_of_Geri" target="_blank" style="color: whitesmoke;">Twitter</a>.</p>
                    <p>That's why I created <a href="/blog/" target="_blank" style="color: whitesmoke;">this blog</a>, for having another support for talking about my projects without having to take the camera and spent the whole day in the video editor.</p>
                    <p>So the time has come, the season two of this 2021 project, this is the final stretch, most of the things are done and now I need to patiently polish them, so time to end this blog post and continue my way for finishing this game.</p>
