                        <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">Development</h1>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">Mercorona's development was mainly divided by two parts, the <strong>Game Jam</strong> and the <strong>Post Jam</strong>.</p>
                        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Part 1</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">It was March 16th and the lockdown had just started, then someone decided to start a Game Jam called the "Coronavirus Game Jam", a lot of people joined and some games such as <a href="https://geri8.itch.io/isoulated" target="_blank">Isoulated</a> were created there, in this case, Mercorona started as a game from another team. They made a huge effort for making that possible and a lot of hard work was inverted in there. This version consisted in just the infinite runner part and quite a lot of bugs.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div style="overflow: hidden;">
                    <aside><img src="Images/MercoronaSkins.jpg" height="400vh" style="float: left;"></aside>
                    <div style="color: whitesmoke;">
                        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Part 2</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">The jam had ended and the team needed another programmer to replace the other one, who didn't have more time to work on this project.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">So here I appeared, a random person appeared from nowhere who started to solve some bugs and implement some new features, such as the Google Play's achievement system and a skin selector. Meanwhile the artists started to rework some assets as well as the musician and SFX artist polished some of their tracks.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">After that we sent the compile to Google for publishing that on the Google Play Store, but one day later our game was suspended from there. We tried to hide de virus two more times and suddenly Google banned us from there because of the name, at least you can still play the game on <a href="https://geri8.itch.io/mercorona" target="_blank">itch.io</a></p>

                            <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">Conclusions</h1>
                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Problems</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">During the development of this project there were basically two problems:</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>My knowledge of Unity:</strong> At that time, my level of programming was quite low, basically being in that project helped me to learn a lot more of Unity and with that, be more prepared for future projects.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>The programmer change problem:</strong> A huge problem was that the project was started by Balas and ended by me, that time when we changed was a bit confusing because you had a working game but with no idea how, so I lost some time trying to understand the whole logic of the project.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div style="color: whitesmoke;">
                        <div style="color: whitesmoke; text-align: justify;">
                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Improvements</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">After some time from this project, I can see that there are some improvements that could have been done.</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Difficulty curve:</strong> The game in the beginning is really short but as you progress in it, each game becomes larger than the last one and then there appear situations where a single game is too long so the only way to end it is by dying and not by arriving to the end of the level.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Lack of content for engaging the player:</strong> We had skins and some achievements, but nothing more, at the beginning you started unlocking some but after that you started to lose interest in getting them and then got tired of playing the game, that's something that could have been fixed by adding an in-game currency with upgrades or maybe some powerups to unlock.</li>
