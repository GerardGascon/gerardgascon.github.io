This Game Jam had no theme, the only rule that you had to follow was to <strong>make a game about Discs and Rooms</strong>. This game was made with Unity and didn't won any prize but it's worth to mention this game for being one of the most polished games I made during that year.</p>

                        <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">Development</h1>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">The development of this game started from nowhere because the jam was announced right before it started and so we made a team really fast and started making a game about <strong>Discs and Rooms</strong>.</p>
                        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">The idea</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">The main idea of the game was that <strong>the player's spine is his health</strong>. The artist quickly started designing the character, which was really similar to the fall guys' guy and after some time she decided to make the disks CDs and suddenly CD-ROOM was born.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Development</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">We could say that the development of this game was plenty of voluntary crunch, since we wanted to make the game as good as possible using the maximum time possible.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">During that time I was who mainly programmed the UI, the AI of the enemies and the player, Balas was who programmed the game boss, the procedural generation and made all the shaders of the game and some VFXs.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">There were also Charlie, the game designer and 2D artist who designed the behaviours of the enemies and the UI of the game, Max, the 3D artist who modeled all the game and last but not least, Choli and Sonucais, the ones who made all the sounds and music for the game. After making all the game, we published the game on <a href="https://charliebluewood.itch.io/cd-room">itch.io</a>.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">This game ended up being one of my best games I had ever done, the main reason was because this jam was also the longest one and also because we put all the effort we could so the game could be as good as possible.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">The main things to highlight are its procedural generation which works by arranging a bunch of empty rooms and then inserting there some random premade obstacles, the enemies' AI where each one is completely different than the others and makes the game feel more fun as you have to learn how each one works and of course the boss fight which has a lot of patterns that change as you make him more damage.</p>

                            <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">Conclusions</h1>
                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Problems</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">During the development of this project there were basically two problems:</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>My knowledge of Unity:</strong> At that time, my level of programming was quite low, basically being in that project helped me to learn a lot more of Unity and with that, be more prepared for future projects.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>The programmer change problem:</strong> A huge problem was that the project was started by Balas and ended by me, that time when we changed was a bit confusing because you had a working game but with no idea how, so I lost some time trying to understand the whole logic of the project.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Improvements</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">After some time from this project, I can see that there are some improvements that could have been done.</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Difficulty curve:</strong> The game in the beginning is really short but as you progress in it, each game becomes larger than the last one and then there appear situations where a single game is too long so the only way to end it is by dying and not by arriving to the end of the level.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Lack of content for engaging the player:</strong> We had skins and some achievements, but nothing more, at the beginning you started unlocking some but after that you started to lose interest in getting them and then got tired of playing the game, that's something that could have been fixed by adding an in-game currency with upgrades or maybe some powerups to unlock.</li>
