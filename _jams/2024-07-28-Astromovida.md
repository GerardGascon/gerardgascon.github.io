**WARNING**: To be able to control this spaceship you need an advanced space control panel, if you do not have this you
will not be able to play.

The captain of the spaceship has fallen unconscious during a space accident, it's time for you, as a fellow co-pilot and
with your great inexperience, to try to prevent this situation from getting worse (it will).
