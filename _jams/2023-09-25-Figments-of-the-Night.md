You wake up on a deserted island with no memory of who you are or what you are doing there. You will have to explore its landscapes, meet its other visitors and find clues in order to discover the truth behind this mysterious place...

or

you can simply relax in this paradise in the middle of the ocean and accept ignorance... whatever you do, do it before you have to go to sleep... to sleep...
