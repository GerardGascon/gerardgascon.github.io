You are in Ropasci Forest, where some evil creatures are waiting to defy you in a 1 vs 1 Rock Paper Scissor duel. Escape through the forest by keeping all of your fingers or tricking your adversaries.

You will be rewarded by winnng matches, but if you loose they will keep one of your fingers by eating them, cutting them or who knows what else... You can trick them, though! Use fake wood or meat fingers in order to keep yours, and pray so that they don't notice the deception...
