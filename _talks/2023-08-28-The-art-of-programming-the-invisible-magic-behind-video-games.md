This talk was about game feel and how by adding some elements that have a minimal impact on the game design, such as coyote time, stretch and squash or particles, among others, can change how your game feels as well as making it more fun to play.

This talk was a mix between a normal PowerPoint presentation and a Unity game whose scenes where assigned to some slides.

Every slide had a short Visual Basic code that launched Unity with an argument telling it to load a specific scene.
