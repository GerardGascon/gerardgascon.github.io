Game jams are really fun events where a ton of effort are spent in order to create a game in a limited amount of time under a certain theme. But not all people know how to structure the development of their project.

Therefore, we decided to make a talk about how we tried to organize our game development process for the [IndieSpainJam 2023](/jams/Figments-of-the-Night), a jam we came out in 5th place.

As this game jam was our first time using Godot Engine, we wanted to make use of it in order to make this presentation possible.
