Every game developer has abandoned or "failed" at completing at least one of their projects. Surprisingly, even though it's a wide-spread fact that this happens, no one wants to talk about it.

For this reason, I wanted to showcase some of my abandoned projects and tell other developers how abandoning them don't make you a worse developer, but they help you become a better one.
