Usually some developers decide to challenge themselves to make a game for retro consoles.

Even myself some time ago dived deeply into the *homebrew* scene of the Mega Drive, in order to challenge myself in a quite peculiar way, by making a real retro game.

In this talk I show where the curiosity of making such games comes from and how any person can start making their own. Talking about the tools and limitations that developers need to use in order to accomplish such goals.
