This is a talk that I gave right before the one I did at the [final phase of the XXIII Exporecerca Jove]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _talks/2022-03-26-Game-Development-in-16-bits.md %})

In this talk I dived deep into the whole process of the development and each one of the little steps that I took during it.

While explaining the process I was also making small explanations of the limitations that I found during each feature development and how I worked with them.
