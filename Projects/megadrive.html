                    <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">The <strong>SEGA Mega Drive</strong> is quite an old console right? But that's no reason for not trying to make a game, so here I am, procrastinating while trying to accomplish my goal to complete a full game that can runs on original hardware without any problem.</p>

                    <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">The reason</h1>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">Sometimes while I'm really bored I start thinking about <strong>weird projects to do</strong> and suddenly a random video pops up and for some reason that was about making a game for the NES.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">When I went to search how expensive that was I remembered that I had a Mega Drive at home so after a quick Google search I found the solution with the name of <strong>SGDK</strong>.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">After some time of doing nothing I got something, a ball moving across the screen, right after that I wanted more so I decided to work a bit on a project and then start a <a style="color: whitesmoke;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB669nq6P6WU2mP6RYVtEig">YouTube channel</a> with the main goal of keeping me motivated for finishing that amazing project.</p>

                        <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">How</h1>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">Nowadays, we make games using engines like Unity or Unreal, but there is still a few people that want to make games for "retro" consoles, such as the NES or in this case, the Mega Drive. This type of games receive the name of <strong>Homebrew Games</strong>, for being games made by hobbyists for proprietary hardware.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 20px;">But what enables us to easily create our games for that consoles is by using some tools for making our life a bit easier, such as sprite editors which didn't exist at that time or SDKs like the <strong><a style="color: whitesmoke;" href="https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK" target="_blank">SGDK</a></strong> for the Mega Drive, which enables me to program the games using C and then compile it as a ROM.</p>
                    </div>

                <div style="overflow: hidden;">
                    <aside><img src="Images/MercoronaSkins.jpg" height="400vh" style="float: left;"></aside>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Part 2</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">The jam had ended and the team needed another programmer to replace the other one, who didn't have more time to work on this project.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">So here I appeared, a random person appeared from nowhere who started to solve some bugs and implement some new features, such as the Google Play's achievement system and a skin selector. Meanwhile the artists started to rework some assets as well as the musician and SFX artist polished some of their tracks.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">After that we sent the compile to Google for publishing that on the Google Play Store, but one day later our game was suspended from there. We tried to hide de virus two more times and suddenly Google banned us from there because of the name, at least you can still play the game on <a href="https://geri8.itch.io/mercorona" target="_blank">itch.io</a></p>

                            <h1 style="font-size: 50px; text-align: center;">Conclusions</h1>
                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Problems</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">During the development of this project there were basically two problems:</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>My knowledge of Unity:</strong> At that time, my level of programming was quite low, basically being in that project helped me to learn a lot more of Unity and with that, be more prepared for future projects.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>The programmer change problem:</strong> A huge problem was that the project was started by Balas and ended by me, that time when we changed was a bit confusing because you had a working game but with no idea how, so I lost some time trying to understand the whole logic of the project.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div style="overflow: hidden;">
                    <aside><img src="Images/MercoronaSuperArtwork2.png" style="float: right;" height="400vh"></aside>
                    <div style="color: whitesmoke;">
                        <div style="color: whitesmoke; text-align: justify;">
                            <h3 style="font-size: 30px; margin-left: 16px; line-height: 25px;">Improvements</h3>
                            <p style="margin-top: -10px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px;">After some time from this project, I can see that there are some improvements that could have been done.</p>
                            <ul style="font-size: 20px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: -10px; line-height: 22px;">
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Difficulty curve:</strong> The game in the beginning is really short but as you progress in it, each game becomes larger than the last one and then there appear situations where a single game is too long so the only way to end it is by dying and not by arriving to the end of the level.</li>
                                <li style="list-style-position: inside;"><strong>Lack of content for engaging the player:</strong> We had skins and some achievements, but nothing more, at the beginning you started unlocking some but after that you started to lose interest in getting them and then got tired of playing the game, that's something that could have been fixed by adding an in-game currency with upgrades or maybe some powerups to unlock.</li>
